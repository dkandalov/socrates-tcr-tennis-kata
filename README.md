### socrates-tcr-tennis-kata

We did some TCR at SoCraTes UK with the tennis kata (https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/master/katas/Tennis%20Scoring.md)

Thanks to Dmitry for organising and Pawel for timing, and all for contributing in our little mob rotation.

#### NB.

This repo is called tcr-webserver because I created it intending to try some kotlin springboot webflux stuff.
It was repurposed.
